This file provides information about the DWI-DRO data set in the folder "ADC_SNR_DRO_DICOM".


Overview
--------
“ADC_SNR_DRO_DICOM” folder contains simulated trace-DWI DICOM (magnitude image) series 
generated by mono-exponential diffusion model for a range of tissue-relevant ADC and 
SNR values to evaluate performance of quantitative DWI analysis SW against ground truth.
 

Functionality
-------------
Each DRO image contains magnitude DWI intensities for a single b-value.  The simulated object 
consists of 396 zones assembled in 22 rows by 18 columns, where each rectangular zone contains 
16x20 pixels.  SNR and ADC were monotonically varied across rows and columns respectively.  
Input SNR of the “b=0 DWI” increased as {1,2,5,10,15,…,100} going from image bottom-to-top 
(i.e. patient’s posterior-to-anterior), whereas ADC increased as {0.1,0.3,0.5,…,3.5x10^-3mm^2/s} 
going from image left-to-right (i.e. patient’s right-to-left).  In addition, the leftmost 
20-pixel-wide column of each image contains signal-free pure (Rician) noise sample. 

Rician noise is generated from geomtric mean of three-direction magnitude data (b>0) of quadrature 
(pseudo)acquisiton with random (Gaussian) channel noise of STD = 10. Pixel values are truncated 
to 16-bit depth (unsigned integers) without extra scaling. Each series includes six images 
that simulate b-values (s/mm^2): 0, 100, 500, 800, 2000 and 4000. Series 101-401 are "repeats" 
with independent noise samples assuming single average per b-value. Series 501 contains images 
with additional averaging per b-value: 3 (b=0), 1 (b=100), 2 (b=500), 4 (b=800), 6 (b=2000), and
8 (b=4000). DICOM header is in "classic" (uncompressed) format with public tags following standard 
DWI Macro (closest to Philips DICOM). Private tags are intentionally not used. 


Distribution
------------
DRO is shared as a ZIP of the DICOM folder and "README" usage instructions.
The DICOM directory contains five series (or subdirectories) labeled as 101, 201, 301, 401 and 501
in "classic" format. Each series includes six 16-bit images (256 Kb) of a single axial slice
labeled with the corresponding b-values (also recorded in image DICOM tag (0018, 9087)). 
Trace-image (isotropic) type is reflected in "diffusion directionality" tag (0018, 9075) and 
"image type" tag (0008,0008). DWI DICOM is validated against DICOM DWI macro:

Installation
------------
Unzip the "distribution" to read instructions and analyze any/all DRO DICOM series.


Usage (Quick Reference)
-----------------------
To visualize DRO parameter blocks,load and view the series using your DICOM reader/viewer of choice.
Run your quantitative DWI analysis SW on any of the DRO DICOM series, selecting all or a subset  
of b-values. To compare with the true (input) values, select ROI on the rectangular pixel blocks,
as explained in "Functionality" section above and/or guided visually by b=0 image (e.g.,for input SNR) 
and b=100 image (e.g., for input ADC). Use series 101-401 as "multi-pass" proxy to test SW capabilities 
to estimate true "noise" and SNR bias as a function of b-value (and ADC). Use series 501 to analyze
Rician noise bias as a function of number of averages (per b-value).

(B) Private DICOM tags are not used, thus proprietary SW that relies on "private" tags, may
not process this DRO, unless DICOM is modified (by the user).
