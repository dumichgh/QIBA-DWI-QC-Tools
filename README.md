# QIBA-DWI-QC-Tools
This repository contains QC tools and sample DICOM for QIBA DWI phantom (QIDW collection backup)

“ADC_SNR_DRO_DICOM” folder contains simulated trace-DWI DICOM (magnitude image) series 
generated by mono-exponential diffusion model for a range of tissue-relevant ADC and 
SNR values to evaluate performance of quantitative DWI analysis SW against ground truth.
